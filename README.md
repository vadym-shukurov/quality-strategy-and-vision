## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap: The Quality Playbook

Click through the sections below to explore the specific frameworks, technical patterns, and cultural pillars of this vision.

### 🏛️ Pillar 1: Strategic Governance
*Executive-level oversight and decision-making frameworks.*
* **[The Quality Manifesto](./README.md#the-quality-philosophy):** My core belief system on Customer-Centric Quality.
* **[Quality Gates Matrix](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/governance/quality-gates-matrix.md):** The mandatory checkpoints from Ideation to Production.
* **[Risk-Based Testing (ROI)](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/strategy/risk-based-testing-framework.md):** How we optimize testing effort to maximize business value.

### ⚡ Pillar 2: High-Traffic Resilience
*Architecting for scale and ensuring the system survives the "untestable."*
* **[Resilience Patterns](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/resilience/high-traffic-patterns.md):** Circuit breakers, Idempotency, and Load Shedding for Payments.
* **[Vendor Reliability](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/resilience/third-party-vendor-reliability.md):** Managing the quality of external dependencies (Stripe, AWS, etc.).
* **[AI-Safety Governance](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/governance/ai-safety-and-sdlc.md):** Guardrails for AI-assisted engineering.

### 👥 Pillar 3: Culture & People
*Empowering the team and defining the "Modern SDET."*
* **[Mentorship & Ownership](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/culture/mentorship-and-ownership.md):** Transitioning from a QA bottleneck to an "Engineering Excellence" model.
* **[Human-Intuition Testing](./README.md#3-the-human-element-high-value-manual-testing):** The strategic role of Exploratory and Field Testing.

### 📊 Pillar 4: Quality Intelligence
*The data-driven evidence of engineering success.*
* **[Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/vadym-shukurov/quality-strategy-and-vision/blob/main/metrics/quality-intelligence-dashboard.md):** Beyond DORA—measuring Defect Escape Rates and the Cost of Quality.
